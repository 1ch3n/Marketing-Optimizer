# Use cases
### There are a few aspects that need to be considered when selecting a marketing use case for Reinforcement Learning concepts:

Access to rewards - an agent must be able to receive feedback from the environment in order to learn which actions are more likely to lead to rewards. Thus, you always need to ensure that there is conceptual and/or technical ability to measure performance of the predicted actions and then to send them back to the agent. Data velocity and volume - a good use case is when an agent makes a lot of decisions in a short span of time, so it continuously gets new experiences and therefore has opportunities to learn.
Exploration-exploitation trade-off - an agent must explore the environment in order to learn about it. If the agent does not explore, then it will not be able to learn which actions are more likely to lead to rewards. It means that at certain times, most noticeably at the beginning of its lifespan, the agent will make mistakes. A use case with no room for errors or experimentation is most likely not the best choice.

The applications of Reinforcement Learning in marketing are vast and diverse. Consider the following use cases:

Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) - Reinforcement Learning can help advertisers personalize their content to increase the percentage of website visitors who take a desired action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading a white paper.
Marketing automation - Reinforcement Learning can automate various marketing tasks, such as email marketing campaigns, social media engagement, and content creation. By analyzing the effectiveness of different marketing strategies, Reinforcement Learning algorithms can optimize these tasks to achieve specific goals, such as generating leads, driving traffic, or increasing brand awareness.
Support for ad bidding - Reinforcement Learning algorithms can help with the ad bidding process in real-time, taking into account factors such as user demographics, browsing behavior, and past interactions with ads. The augmented bid adjustments can be passed to downstream advertising products, such as Google Smart Bidding.
Dynamic pricing - Reinforcement Learning can dynamically adjust product pricing based on factors such as demand, supply, and competitor pricing. This dynamic approach ensures that products are priced competitively while maximizing profitability.
