# Budget Optimization for Reset Lifestyle Products BV.

The repository contains the following files:

- marketing_opt_report.ipynb: a notebook designed on Jupyter. As it reads auto_report_read_file.py, the notebook itself is clear and easy to use by the end-user (Blue Field Agency marketeers): requires installing all needed packages, running all cells and modifying the parameter cell. One final function (marketing_optimizer) executes all previously defined functions.
- auto_report_read_file.py: a python file with all functions contributing to a final product of the marketing optimizer for Blue Field Agency.
- marketing_opt_report_vscode_v1.ipynb: a notebook designed on VS Code. Requires installing all needed packages, running all cells and modifying the parameter cell. One final function (marketing_optimizer) executes all previously defined functions.
- test_dataset.csv: an artificially generated data set mimicking the original data from RESET BV. Insert the pathname to this csv in the parameter cell of marketing_opt_report.ipynb or marketing_opt_report_vscode_v1.ipynb.
